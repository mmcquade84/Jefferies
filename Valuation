-- SQL Script for Financial Analysis and Valuation in Investment Banking
-- This script is designed to perform comprehensive financial analysis and valuation
-- to assist in investment decisions for an investment banking project.
-- It involves pulling data from existing databases and CSV files, performing complex financial analysis,
-- and generating detailed reports.

-- Step 1: Load data from CSV files into staging tables
-- Assuming the CSV files are located in a directory accessible by the database

-- Create staging tables for loading CSV data
CREATE TABLE Staging_Companies (
    CompanyID INT,
    CompanyName VARCHAR(255),
    Industry VARCHAR(50),
    MarketCap DECIMAL(15, 2),
    Revenue DECIMAL(15, 2),
    EBITDA DECIMAL(15, 2),
    NetIncome DECIMAL(15, 2),
    TotalAssets DECIMAL(15, 2),
    TotalLiabilities DECIMAL(15, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Staging_FinancialStatements (
    StatementID INT,
    CompanyID INT,
    StatementType VARCHAR(50),
    StatementDate DATE,
    LineItem VARCHAR(255),
    Amount DECIMAL(15, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Staging_MarketData (
    DataID INT,
    CompanyID INT,
    DataDate DATE,
    StockPrice DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Volume INT
);

-- Load data from CSV files into staging tables
-- Assuming a MySQL environment with the LOAD DATA INFILE command
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/companies.csv'
INTO TABLE Staging_Companies
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/financial_statements.csv'
INTO TABLE Staging_FinancialStatements
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/market_data.csv'
INTO TABLE Staging_MarketData
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

-- Step 2: Create target tables for storing cleaned data and analysis results

CREATE TABLE Companies (
    CompanyID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CompanyName VARCHAR(255),
    Industry VARCHAR(50),
    MarketCap DECIMAL(15, 2),

    EBITDA DECIMAL(15, 2),
    NetIncome DECIMAL(15, 2),
    TotalAssets DECIMAL(15, 2),

CREATE TABLE FinancialStatements (

CREATE TABLE MarketData (
    DataID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CompanyID INT,
    DataDate DATE,
    StockPrice DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Volume INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CompanyID) REFERENCES Companies(CompanyID)
);

CREATE TABLE ValuationMetrics (
    MetricID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CompanyID INT,
    ValuationDate DATE,

    P_E DECIMAL(10, 2),
    P_S DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CompanyID) REFERENCES Companies(CompanyID)
);

-- Step 3: Transfer data from staging tables to target tables
-- Clean and transform the data during the transfer

INSERT INTO Companies (CompanyID, CompanyName, Industry, MarketCap, Revenue, EBITDA, NetIncome, TotalAssets, TotalLiabilities)
SELECT DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT
    DataID,
    CompanyID,
    DataDate,

-- Step 4: Create views for complex analysis
-- View to calculate Enterprise Value (EV) and key valuation metrics
CREATE VIEW CompanyValuation AS
SELECT

-- Step 5: Create stored procedures for advanced financial analysis

    SET FreeCashFlow = NetIncome * 0.80;

    -- Calculate Terminal Value using perpetuity growth model
    SET TerminalValue = FreeCashFlow * (1 + GrowthRate) / (DiscountRate - GrowthRate);

    -- Calculate DCF Value (simplified 1-year projection)
    SET DCFValue = FreeCashFlow / (1 + DiscountRate) + TerminalValue / (1 + DiscountRate);

    SELECT CompanyID, Revenue, EBITDA, NetIncome, FreeCashFlow, TerminalValue, DCFValue;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Step 6: Create a function to assess financial health based on key ratios
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION AssessFinancialHealth (CompanyID INT) RETURNS VARCHAR(255)
BEGIN
    DECLARE DebtToEquity DECIMAL(10, 2);
    DECLARE CurrentRatio DECIMAL(10, 2);

    -- Assume a fixed Current Ratio for demonstration purposes
    SET CurrentRatio = 1.5; -- For simplicity

    ELSE
        SET FinancialHealth = 'Unhealthy';
    END IF;

    RETURN FinancialHealth;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Step 7: Generate complex reports using advanced queries
-- Query to generate a detailed company valuation report
SELECT
    v.CompanyID,
    v.CompanyName,

    v.EnterpriseValue,
    v.EV_EBITDA,

    CompanyValuation v
ORDER BY

-- Query to generate a financial health assessment report
SELECT
    c.CompanyName,
    AssessFinancialHealth(c.CompanyID) AS FinancialHealth
FROM
    Companies c;

-- Query to generate a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation report
CALL CalculateDCF(1, 0.05, 0.10); -- Example for company with ID 1

-- Generate reports for market data analysis
SELECT
    m.CompanyID,
    c.CompanyName,
    m.DataDate,
    m.StockPrice,
    m.Volume,
    (m.StockPrice * m.Volume) AS MarketValueTraded
FROM
    MarketData m
JOIN
    Companies c ON m.CompanyID = c.CompanyID
ORDER BY
    m.DataDate DESC;

-- creating necessary tables, creating views and stored procedures for complex analysis,
